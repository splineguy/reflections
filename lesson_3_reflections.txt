When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If you are going to be accessing your repository from different computers or
  sharing across networks with collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If someone else is working on the repository and pushes changes
	to GitHub, you wouldn't want their work to automaticlaly be pushed
	to you local repository.
