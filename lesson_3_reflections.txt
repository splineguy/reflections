When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If you are going to be accessing your repository from different computers or
  sharing across networks with collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If someone else is working on the repository and pushes changes
	to GitHub, you wouldn't want their work to automaticlaly be pushed
	to you local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

	A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub onto a new repository still
	on GitHub.  It links back to the original repository and allows for
	new changes to be made and committed without changing the original repository.
	This can be used to create a separate or new version of a project.
	A clone is a copy of a repository, generally made locally.  It is pulled 
	down from GitHub so that changes can be made and then pushed back to GitHub
	Branches are lines of commits within a repository so that changes can
	be made without losing track of a version in the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It provides the user with a copy of the shared repository so that comparisons
	can be made to it to see what changes have occurred only locally.
